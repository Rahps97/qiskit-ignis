    Added a graph decoder that uses clustering and
     max_matching, defined as cluster_decoding.
    It can be accessed similarly to matching. Change the 
    algorithm = 'matching' to algorithm = 'clustering' to use it.
    Draw 3d and 2d error garph method added. Ex:  
    For 2D:
    code = RepetitionCode(3,1)
    Graph = GraphDecoder(code)
    Error_Graph = Graph.make_error_graph('1 0  00 10 00')['0']
    Graph.draw_2d_error_graph(Error_Graph)
    For 3D:
    code = RepetitionCode(3,1)
    Graph = GraphDecoder(code)
    Error_Graph = Graph.make_error_graph('1 0  00 10 00')['0']
    Graph.draw_3d_error_graph(Error_Graph)
    Function for 3d and 2d decoded graph also added. Ex:
    For 2D:
    code = RepetitionCode(3,1)
    Graph = GraphDecoder(code)
    Error_Graph = Graph.make_error_graph('1 0  00 10 00')['0']
    [logical, Edgelist, nodelist]=Graph.cluster_decoding('1 0  00 10 00')
    Graph.draw_2d_decoded_graph(Error_Graph,Edgelist,nodelist)
    For 3D:
    code = RepetitionCode(3,1)
    Graph = GraphDecoder(code)
    Error_Graph = Graph.make_error_graph('1 0  00 10 00')['0']
    [logical, Edgelist, nodelist]=Graph.cluster_decoding('1 0  00 10 00')
    Graph.draw_3d_decoded_graph(Error_Graph,Edgelist,nodelist)
